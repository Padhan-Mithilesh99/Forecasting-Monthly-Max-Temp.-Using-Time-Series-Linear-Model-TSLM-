# Forecasting-Monthly-Max-Temp.-Using-Time-Series-Linear-Model-TSLM-

This project focuses on forecasting the monthly maximum temperatures (TMAX) for Port Blair, India, from 2000 to 2024 using a Time Series Linear Model (TSLM) approach.
Daily temperature data were sourced from NOAAâ€™s National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) and processed to remove missing values and standardize formats. After aggregating daily records into monthly averages, a predictive model was developed to capture long-term trends and seasonal patterns.
The model was trained on data from 2000 to 2023 and validated on 2024 predictions using error metrics like Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
This analysis provides insights into climatic trends in a tropical coastal city and demonstrates the application of simple, interpretable time series models for environmental forecasting.
